        <h1>1.1.1 In the Beginning</h1>
        <p>The Internet began in the late 1960's as a experiment in the design of robust computer networks </p>
        <p>The goal of the project was to a construct a network of computers that could still communicate even with the loss of several machines</p>
        <p>The funding for this project cam from the U.S. Department of Defence as they had an interest in building information networks that could withstand nuclear attacks.</p>
        <p>Only defence contractors and academic institutions could gain access to what was known as the ARPAnet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network of the Department of Defence).</p>
        <p>It wasn't until round 1993 that the Internet really took off</p>
